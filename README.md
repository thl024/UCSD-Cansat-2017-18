# UCSD-Cansat-2016-17
All code for CANSAT including ground station


# To-Do:

Tobin: create a function called release that turns a servo 90 degrees.

Angelica: create a function that enables a buzzer.

kkaungyyang(sorry forgot your name): Write a function in pyGCS.py backend class called realTimeMath 
which calculates as many things as you can think of from the data object. 
The data object contains all the stuff in Data.txt but as list of lists. 
So the first list will contain the first column of data including the header name. 
e.g. list[3] = ['Altitude', 86, 50, 65, ...].

Some things you could calculate:
-Launch angle from gps data.
-Average launch velocity from altitude data
-Average velocity from gps data.
If none of this makes sense, dont worry we will go over it briefly wednesday.
